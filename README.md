# Visualizing-and-Classifying-Groups-Abstract-Algebra-
Visualization and machine learning analysis of finite groups from abstract algebra

🌟 Project Overview

This project explores finite groups from abstract algebra through a computational lens. The goal is to understand group structure not only theoretically, but also visually and statistically by combining algebraic concepts with data analysis and machine learning.

We construct several classical groups (cyclic, dihedral, symmetric, quaternion, and direct products), compute their structural properties, visualize Cayley tables and graphs, extract meaningful features, and use machine learning models to classify groups based on their algebraic characteristics.

This project is an experiment in bridging pure mathematics with computational methods — showing how abstract algebra can be explored interactively using Python.
