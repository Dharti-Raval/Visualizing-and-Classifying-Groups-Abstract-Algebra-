# Visualizing-and-Classifying-Groups-Abstract-Algebra-

Overview:

This project studies finite groups using computation, visualization, and machine learning. It constructs classical groups, examines their algebraic structure, visualizes Cayley tables and graphs, extracts meaningful features, and applies ML models to analyze and classify group properties. The goal is to connect abstract algebra with computational experimentation and make group theory more intuitive.

What This Project Covers - 
Construction of groups: Cyclic groups, Dihedral groups, Symmetric groups, Quaternion group, Direct products

Structural analysis: Abelian vs non-abelian, Center and conjugacy classes, Element orders, Normal subgroups, Derived series and solvability

Visualization: Cayley tables (heatmaps), Cayley graphs

Feature engineering: Extraction of numerical features from algebraic properties

Machine learning experiments: Binary classification (abelian prediction), Multiclass classification (group type), Feature importance analysis

Dimensionality reduction: PCA, t-SNE

Tech Stack:
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NetworkX, Scikit-learn

Project Structure:
imports.py, finite_group.py, group_constructors.py, group_collection.py, visualization.py, example_plots.py, feature_extraction.py, labeling.py, abelian_classification.py, multiclass_classification.py, feature_importance.py, embeddings_visualization.py

Motivation:
Abstract algebra is often approached symbolically, but computational tools allow us to experiment with structures, observe patterns, and build intuition. This project demonstrates how mathematical theory can be explored using programming, visualization, and data science methods.
