# Visualizing-and-Classifying-Groups-Abstract-Algebra-

🌟 Overview
This project explores finite groups through computation, visualization, and machine learning. It builds classical groups, analyzes their algebraic structure, visualizes Cayley tables and graphs, extracts meaningful features, and uses ML models to study and classify group properties.
The aim is to bridge abstract algebra with computational experimentation — making group theory more intuitive and interactive.

🧠 Motivation
Abstract algebra is often studied symbolically, but computational tools allow us to experiment with structures, discover patterns, and visualize behavior. This project demonstrates how mathematical theory can be explored using data science techniques.
